# Object Detection on images using YOLO

**YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a very powerful and a fast algorithm in object detection. A strong understanding of the algorithm is essential before we start to code.



The **yolo.py** has the script to detect the objects in the images.

Make sure you have numpy and opencv installed. If not install them using pip

```
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
```


You can now run the file by giving this command on your command promt

```
python yolo.py --image images/ipl.jpeg
```

You can use any image you want after the `--image` argument. Make sure you give the right path.

Press **q** to quit the window of the image showing object detection
